'''### How to Use It
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to create and interact with the `Graph` class.

#### Example 1: Undirected & Unweighted Graph
Let's create a simple social network. '''

# 1. Create an undirected graph
social_network = Graph(directed=False)

# 2. Add edges (friendships)
social_network.add_edge("Alice", "Bob")
social_network.add_edge("Alice", "Carol")
social_network.add_edge("Bob", "David")
social_network.add_edge("Carol", "David")
social_network.add_edge("Eve", "Frank") # A separate group

# 3. Print the graph to see its structure
print("--- Social Network (Undirected) ---")
print(social_network)

# 4. Get specific information
print(f"Alice's friends: {social_network.get_neighbors('Alice').keys()}")
print(f"All people in the network: {social_network.get_vertices()}")

# 1. Create a directed graph
flight_routes = Graph(directed=True)

# 2. Add routes with costs (weights)
flight_routes.add_edge("New York", "London", weight=450)
flight_routes.add_edge("London", "Paris", weight=50)
flight_routes.add_edge("Paris", "Tokyo", weight=800)
flight_routes.add_edge("New York", "Tokyo", weight=1100) # Direct flight
flight_routes.add_edge("London", "New York", weight=430) # Return flight

# 3. Print the graph
print("\n--- Flight Routes (Directed & Weighted) ---")
print(flight_routes)

# 4. Get specific information
ny_destinations = flight_routes.get_neighbors("New York")
print(f"Flights from New York: {ny_destinations}")
print(f"Cost from New York to London: ${ny_destinations.get('London')}")
